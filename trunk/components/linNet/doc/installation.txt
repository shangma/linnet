* Installation of linNet

To install linNet copy the appropriate folder
linNet/bin/<system>/[DEBUG|PRODUCTION] with the pre-compiled executable
binary to a location of your choice. The folder to copy is one out of
those, which contain the linNet executable and the folder private with
application resources. The DEBUG compilations are suggested.

The path to the installation location should not contain any blanks.

Add the variable LINNET_HOME to your system environment. The value of this
variable is the name and path of the copied folder, i.e. the folder where
the linNet executable is located in.

Add the name and path of the copied folder to the system PATH variable.

Under Linux, the executable file needs to be tagged as such. After copying
the file, use chmod +x ... to make it executable. Please see the Linux man
page for details.

To test the installation open a shell window, cd to any folder and type
linNet --version
then type
linNet -o -l <linNetComponentDir>/circuits/2poleLP.cnl
Please note, that the path <linNetComponentDir> to the folder circuits
with some sample netlist files differs depending on the archive you've
downloaded. The archive with source files uses a more complex folder
structure as appropriate for the build process. The place holder
<linNetComponentDir> has to be replaced accordingly.

Both commands must complete without any error message. Double check that
the folder 2poleLP has been created in the current working directory and
that it contains the other folder private in turn holding a number of
about five Octave script files.
