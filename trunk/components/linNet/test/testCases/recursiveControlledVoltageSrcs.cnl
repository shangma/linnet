 * @file recursiveControlledVoltageSrcs.cnl
 *   Test case for linNet.
 * This test case proves the correct behavior of two recursively related
 * voltage controlled voltage sources.
 *   Manually figured out results are:
 * U_N3 = k2/(1+k1*k2) * U_in
 * I_k1 = [(k1-1)*k2*R1 - R2]/[R1*R2*(1 + k1*k2)] * U_in
 * I_k2 = (1-k1)*k2/[(1+k1*k2)*R2] * U_in
 *   These results need to be reproduced by linNet.
