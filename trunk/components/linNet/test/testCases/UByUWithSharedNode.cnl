 *   Test case for linNet.
 * This test case proves, that a voltage controlled voltage source may
 * have one (but only one) of its control inputs connected to one of the
 * voltage outputs.

/* Expected solution: The solution for the current out of U0 is
   I_U0=U0/(R1+(1+k*R2)), where k is the amplification of the controlled
   source. The voltage at K2 and K3 can easily be derived from this
   current. R3 must not determine the voltage balance but only the current
   distribution between resistor and controlled voltage source. */
