\chapter{Listing of Octave LTI Simulation}
\label{secListingOctaveSimulation}

Here is the listing of an Octave script that can be used to run the LTI
system generated from the bipolar transistor model. In section
\ref{secTModelOpLimits} this script has been used to find the limits of
the linear simulation; with other words the operating range of the
linear solution \linnet{} had figured out. Outside this range the found
solution will no longer show the behavior of the true circuit.

To run the script you need to copy it into the same folder, where
\linnet{} generated the user-defined result \ident{DC}, i.e. where the
script \file{DC.m} is located.
