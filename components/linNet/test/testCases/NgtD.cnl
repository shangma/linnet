 *   Test case for linNet.\n
 * This test case proves, that linNet has no problems with a
 * system, which has a nominator power in s that is greater than the
 * denominator power (for the input current) due to
 * directly connected C.\n
 *   Octave has problems to plot the time domain result, which would
 * contain a dirac function and emits a poor, barely understandable error
 * message. MATLAB also rejects the plot but it responds with a clear and
 * appropriate error message.
