 *   Test case for linNet.\n
 * 16 resistors are connected to an even octagon. This test case
 * demonstrates the power of device relations. The highly complex
 * computation reduces to a very simple final result for the overall
 * resistance due to the symmetry of the circuit.\n
 *   The found solution is easy to prove because of this symmetry. The
 * voltage at the middle of the octagon needs to be half the input
 * voltage.
