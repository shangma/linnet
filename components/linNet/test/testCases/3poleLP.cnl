 * @file 3poleLP.cnl
 *   Test case for linNet.
 * This test case proves the correct computation of a low pass filter with
 * three poles. The inverting op-amp configuration is used with a single
 * resistor in the input (= constant input impedance) and three RC
 * elements in series with a resitor in the feedback line. All resistors
 * are chosen identical so that the amplification begins with 4 with DC
 * operation and falls to 3, 2, 1 when the corner frequencies of the RC
 * elements are reached (or 12, 9.5, 6, 0 dB, respectively). The
 * capacitors are chosen such that these corner frequencies are different
 * enough to see the steps in the Bode plot. The correct behavior is
 * proven in the Bode plot.
