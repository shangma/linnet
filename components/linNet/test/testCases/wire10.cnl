/**
 * @file wire10.cnl
 *   This circuit implements a simple model of an electric wire. The wire
 * is modelled as n identical elements, where each element is a serial
 * inductivity and a parallel capacitance. n=7 is the greatest n with
 * negligible computation time and n=10 as found here is the greatest n,
 * which has been computed, but n=4 is unfortunately the greatest n, which
 * can be handled numerically by Octave 3.8 (elder revisions are worse).
 * MATLAB doesn't have this limitation. It still shows reasonable results
 * for the higher n.\n
 *   The step response of the system shows a stepwise increase of the
 * output voltage till the final value of half the input voltage is
 * reached. The greater n the clearer this pattern becomes.\n
 *
 * n=10
 *
 * Caution: The computation of this circuit took about 13 hours.
 * Extrapolating the computational effort we can expect a couple of month
 * of computation time for n=11.
